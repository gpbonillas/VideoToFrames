# VideoToFrames

This is a simple python script that converts a video file into a series of images. 
The script uses the OpenCV library to read the video file and save each frame as an image. 

The script takes two arguments: 
the path to the video file and the output directory where the images will be saved.

## Usage
Run the script with the following command:

```
python video_to_frames.py
```
